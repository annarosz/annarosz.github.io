      <h3>Simplify a complex business narrative</h3>
      <p>Sunified has a complex business that offers many solutions to a variety of customers, in addition to a collection of different projects launching in various locations across the world. Without a foccussed {go-to-market} strategy, and limited real estate on a website (especially above the fold), we had the potential problem of website visitors feeling excluded or confused about what we do.</p>

      <p><small><strong>The solution</strong></small></p>
      <h3>Website as a directory</h3>
      <p>This iteration of the website reduces the pressure for Sunified to succinctly articulate who they are and what they do and instead it functions as a directory for a myriad of visitors to access information specific to their needs. The structure of the site is designed to scale and accomodate new products, customers and projects as they arise. The site navigation directs the visitor, while the remainder of the content on the homepage creates secondary pathways.</p>

      <h3>Building a custom wesbite using a CMS theme</h3>
      <p>Sunified uses the Hubspot platform as CRM (Customer Relationship Management), as well as a CMS (Content Management System). The website was to be built on this platform, using a theme template, while still being on-brand.</p>

      <p><small><strong>The solution</strong></small></p>
      <h3>Working within and embracing limitations</h3>
      <p>The first step was choosing a theme that offered a wide range of components and the ability for customisation. Through thorough testing of the theme I was able to assess what was and was not able to be built as required. I bridged the gap by creating many custom components using HTML, CSS and some Javascript. There were multiple design iterations based on what was functionally possible with the build.</p>
